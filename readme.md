# Watch and Backup
This program watches a directory and backs it up whenever there is a change made

It keeps a change and error log (change log is not very specific however)

# How to use
If you run it with python, make sure to install the requirements.txt

Python:
    `python wnb.py <folder_name>`

Windows:
    `./wnb.exe <folder_name>`

# Note
Sometimes it backs up twice, or if something like an excel file is created, it does some temp file stuff that causes multiple backups
